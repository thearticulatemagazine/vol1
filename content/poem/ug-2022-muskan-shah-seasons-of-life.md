So my autumn had just begun, 
With all leaves already fallen and heart sunken, 
I lost my favourites whether be my love or uncle,

Started walking on the cold ice, 
All numb with no hope prevailing inside, 
Being all lifeless what winter might damage, 
Little did it know what a sunshine can avenge,

With the budding chemistry of ours, 
Ur gestures care, affection turned me into flower, 
And all life, friends, experiences we take part in, 
Orchiad gets prettier for each moment we live in, 

It's heating up now,
As summer approaching it's vow, 
With passion and confessions as it's peak, 
Sometimes buring sometimes enjoying the heat, 
And I know all seasons will repeat it's cycle, 
Like the life tries to show u r vital,

Not in the chronology nature understand, 
But in an uncanny way that give place to amend, 
Don't expect u to be part of every season,
Whether it be content or sorrow any reason 
Just know won't regret u for the rest of my life, 
Cuz might if autumn drift us apart,
and winter makes a cold heart, 
Experiences would always cherish my spring, 
And Summer would be happy fr it had a perfect fling.
