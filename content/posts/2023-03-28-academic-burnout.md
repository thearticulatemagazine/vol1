Do you experience a lack of motivation? Being drained and agitated? You're not as inspired or as imaginative in your schoolwork as you used to be. Burnout depletes you and leaves you demotivated and jaded.  You can't start anything at all because you feel like there is simply too much to do and that nothing you do would suffice. In academia, issues about mental health aren’t new. It's plausible that you are experiencing an academic burnout, most students have this relatively common condition, yet it remains undetected purely because of ignorance. If identified, it’s effectively treatable. 

## What is it?

Academic burnout is regarded as a negative emotional, bodily, and psychological response to comprehensive curriculum that causes exhaustion, disillusionment, loss of motivation, and subpar academic performance. It results from months or weeks spent studying the same content or focusing on the same topic, or from years of education that was not paused. This shouldn't be confused with the infrequent feeling of unhappiness after putting in a lot of study time or weariness after working late. It's more of a long-term condition spurred on by intense academic or learning effort. 

Scholars from all fields reveal significant levels of anxiety, signs of academic burnout, and even depression due to the many difficulties faced by researchers, including the emotionally taxing nature of their work, the intense stress to publicize, the instability of their financial situation, and uncertainty about their future employment even after working for a considerably large amount.


## Signs of academic burnout

Academic burnout symptoms include far more than just being worn out and having no desire to attend any more classes. Since stress can result in actual, psychosomatic issues like aches, sleeplessness, and depression, it becomes crucial to start reversing burnout as soon as you notice the early signs.  

- You feel exhausted despite getting enough sleep, which results in lethargy and sleeplessness.
- Lacking the motivation or will to finish homework or to attend lectures.
- Irrational outbursts and an inexplicable restlessness brought on by despair.
- Feeling uninspired and lacking the drive to execute tasks and class discussions.
- Losing faith in one's intellectual abilities.
- Failure to meet significant deadlines.
- Increased physical tension and pain, which may appear disguised as headaches, achy muscles, or jaw tension.
- Stress and fatigue causing diseases and distress to occur even more frequently.
- Increase in bad habits like recklessly spending, sleeping in too late, biting your nails, or any other habit you prefer to pick up when you're subjected to stress or being negligent towards yourself.
- Inability to maintain focus during lectures or on schoolwork.
- Feeling disinterested or bored with portions of school or activities you used to enjoy.
- Anxiety, depression-related or inexplicable range of emotions.


## Academic burnout among medical students

Medical students are still advised to persevere through their battle with burnout despite the overwhelming strain brought on by long study sessions, consecutive bombardment of tests, competitive environment, and the ever-evolving nature of medicine. The negative impacts of postgraduate medical burnout can soon affect the college and the local community. The learning environment degrades when pupils are physically exhausted and have high levels of skepticism. First-year medical students are likely to develop unfavorable attitudes if students aren’t provided with proper support for dealing with stress. Furthermore, it reflects itself in their personal affairs. Compared to non-medical students with similar abilities, medical students are more likely to indulge themselves in substance abuse. 

The coping mechanisms for personal stress include consuming more alcohol, adopting an overall pessimistic and nihilistic approach towards life, and retreating socially. Even worse, some students may engage in disruptive behavior that hampers both their relationships with friends as well as family. If burnout sufficiently affects a medical student's personal life, they may even decide to completely change their career path.

## So, why do they suffer more?

- Increasing time limitations -Most students spend most of their time in medical school. A medical student who feels the strain of a demanding study schedule may miss significant social or family gatherings. If a medical student is unable to find a more sustainable schedule or work-life integration, relationships may become strained or even come to an unfortunate end.
- The "absence of mental problems in doctors" – A hoax that physicians and would-be physicians don't cope with mental diseases like depression or anxiety is a significant contributor to burnout among medical students. Medical students may feel alone and in their battle against mental illness because of the stigma attached to seeking treatment.
- Unreal standards - Medical students may feel unqualified because of excessive expectations from their parents, lecturers, and even themselves. Students who experience feelings of inadequacy may internalize their burnout symptoms even more since they refrain from showing any signs of fragility.
