Good day, folks!
So for the first of many or more to come, we have had the privilege to interview Dr. Ram Garg, batch 2018, Governement Medical College, Ratlam, who secured 2nd rank in the MBBS final year university examination conducted by Madhya Pradesh Medical Science University, Jabalpur.

**Q: First of all, congratulations on your over-the-top performance! How do you feel?**

It was surreal and so unexpected, as we had only a few months for the final year. It was truly a good feeling, but, you know, there was a slight disappointment that I didn't secure the first position.😂

**Q: That's fantastic to hear. My next query was limited to the period of the final year. How did you manage in barely 6-7 months?**

I had the mindset that this is the scenario, now I have to make the most of it. Padhna to hai hi, so I just kept studying without thinking or worrying for the exams.

**Q: How did you stay motivated and deal with the confusion and uncertainty that came with the exam schedule and the legal battle concerning the schedule?**

I did not believe in any news or information until I saw the official notice from the university.
And regarding the court cases and all, I used to take them as a source of entertainment.

I just kept studying and did not let it affect me at all. My friends were my biggest supporters. Anytime I used to feel low, my friends would be my go-to people. I would like to mention two of my friends, _Dr. Kavita Chiraniya_ and _Dr. Praveen Patel_. Both of them have supported and helped me so much that it wouldn’t have been possible without them.

**Q: That's hearty to know, sir! Friends are really important.**
**Did you choose standard titles? Coaching platforms and their accompanying notes, or other resources?**

I did watch the videos and take notes, but I also read all the standard books except for surgery. I believe in reading books; I don't feel satisfied without them.

**Q: That’s great advice. Is your study pattern process-oriented or goal-oriented?**

I believe in the process. I love to learn and gain knowledge. I take an interest in the subjects and enjoy reading and learning about them.

**Q: That is incredible! I am sure that contributed to your success immensely!**
**How crucial do you think it is to attend the classes and postings? Is it beneficial to attend them?**

Yes, definitely. Attending postings in your final year is of the utmost importance. The things you learn in that 3-hour period are of such importance. There shouldn’t be any excuses for missing the postings.
Regarding classes, I would say it’s not a compulsion; some are really good while others are not. So you can attend them accordingly.

**Q: Our readers will be overjoyed to learn that they will be able to skip the classes.**
**And we are all aware that studying for this course is extremely demanding. What did you do to unwind or reenergize yourself?**

Whenever I was tired, I would go out with my friends, go out for a bite, or play football.
Honestly, I have no interest in any special activities. So whenever I found some free time, I used to take naps in between.
Bahut soya hu mein.

**Q: Sleeping truly does help.**
**My next question is: Everyone has their own method of studying; there are so many. What strategy or hack did you employ that worked for you?**

Um, I used to study for a 2-3 hour stretch and then use my phone for 10-15 minutes.
Other than that, what worked for me was that I used to study 2-3 subjects every day so that I didn’t get bored. To maintain that energy level and make it interesting, I would switch between subjects while simultaneously completing my topics.

**Q: That is excellent advice for aspiring doctors. Well, what advice would you provide to students from each year in the queue?**

For the first-year students, I would like to say that they should enjoy themselves, have fun, make friends, and not remain stuck with one group of friends. Be open, mingle with everyone, and find your people. Because having good friends is absolutely important. To get through this course, you need to have amazing people around you; otherwise, it might get depressing.

For the second year, I would say, “Ghumo phiro aish kro, but don't neglect studies.” These 2nd-year subjects are the building blocks for the coming subjects.

For third-year fellows, I would say start studying your final year as well. It is important; you might not get the much-needed time in your final year, so make the most of it.

And for the final-year students, be consistent. _Kuch bhi kaisa bhi ho rha ho bas padhte rho. Thoda thoda roz._ Don't think about the future; just keep studying.

**Q: That sounds incredibly valuable.**
**How is your internship going, and what branch do you want to opt for?**

It's going great. I'm learning a lot.
And as for my choice of branches, I don't want to opt for any of the terminal branches.

**Q: What is your opinion regarding National Exit Test(NExT)?** 
Yes, I heard about the seminar held recently by NMC regarding NExt. It must be quite stressful and exhausting for the final-year students, but as such, it is not affecting me much.

**Q: Thank you so much for your time, sir. I had a nice time talking with you.**
**As a final-year student, I was likewise stressed and concerned, but after this chat, I feel rather motivated and inspired. And best wishes, sir, for subsequent challenges and tests!**

Thank you so much. It was a great pleasure. All the best to you for your final year and exams. Do well!
